# GLONASS-orbit-satellite-Constellation-in-GMAT
Following the increasing reliance on satellite-based navigation systems, the need for robust and accurate Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystems (AOCS) has become a fundamental requirement in modern Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This study focuses on the modeling and analysis of the AOCS used in the GLONASS satellite constellation, particularly emphasizing the structural configuration, control strategies, and technological upgrades introduced with the GLONASS-K2 generation. By simulating orbital dynamics using GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool) and evaluating the control behavior under varying environmental conditions, this project aims to assess the precision, stability, and responsiveness of the GLONASS AOCS. The implementation phase includes system modeling, algorithmic control logic, and trajectory validation based on real-world mission parameters.
